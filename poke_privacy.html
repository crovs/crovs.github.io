Last updated: August 1, 2025

Thank you for choosing PéScan – Pokémon Card Scanner (“PéScan,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).

1. Information We Do Not Collect

Personal Data: We do not collect or store your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
Usage Data & Analytics: We do not collect analytics, crash reports, or usage logs.
Location, Contacts, Photos: We do not access your device’s location, contacts, photos, or any other personal files.
2. Camera & OCR Processing

On-Device Only: All card-scanning (camera capture and OCR text recognition) is performed locally on your device.
No Uploads: Your images and scan data never leave your device and are not transmitted to our servers.
3. Subscriptions & RevenueCat

We use RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions and purchases.

What’s Shared: When you subscribe, we share only a unique app‐generated identifier and your purchase receipt with RevenueCat.
RevenueCat’s Privacy: RevenueCat’s own Privacy Policy describes how they handle any data you provide through their system.
